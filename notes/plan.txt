Chap Shmup Plan

=== Sept 10, 2012 ===
So as of now, this is definitely a side-project, schoolwork comes first, bla bla bla. First major milestone is a little demo level, with some graphics that are marginally better than these ones, a half-decent GUI, maybe some enemies that actually shoot back! Also, definitely get the full plan together by then.

From there, the plan is to make a game where the player's ship has upgradable and customizable features, so there's replayability and such. Games must be saveable! Also, a method of ending levels and allowing the player to choose where to travel.
The plot is that the you are on Earth c. 3000 CE, but an invasion of the planet by a small rebel group requires you to evacuate, quickly, to a friend's place on Pluto (which is unaffected thanks to its non-planet status). Afterwards, you travel from location to location (i.e. planets, floating bases, jump ports, etc.), and each trip is a shmup level (all procedurally generated). There will be a story to guide the player along to fulfilling certain available goals, such as destroying the rebellion, creating a new home, or whatever. It's basically a silly space-RPG.

TODO Soon:
- Enemy presets: given a certain label, create a type of enemy (i.e. moving, shooting, bigger, etc.)
- Better level: setup a sort of demo level that ends!
- Better graphics: actually spend some time on the graphics, and add some SFX like shitty explosions
- Sounds: Shitty laser sounds
- GUI: Show shit about our health
- Collision boxes: tweak the enemies/game objects so that their collision area can be a bit smaller than their image rect, or allow multiple rects?
